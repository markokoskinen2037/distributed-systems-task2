- Three states as described in the picture.
- Tokens represent time or cars - depending on situation. This should become obvious from node names.
- When a treshold of time (10,10,5) passes then then lights switch. 
- Light switching goes in a cycle in same order. (main-side-cross)
- Cars can stop during green light but time will move on resulting in 0-10 / 0-10 / 0-5 cars passing per light switch, (5max for side road greenlight)
